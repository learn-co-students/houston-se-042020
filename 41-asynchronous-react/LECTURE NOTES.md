### Learning Goals

- Recognize common React Lifecycle methods and when they will be invoked
- Use `componentDidMount` to run make a fetch after the first render
- Use fetch to save data back to the server after an event



### Vocabulary

* Lifecycle Methods 
  * Function attached to an object
  * That are invoked automatically at key points during the objects "life-cycle"
  * render 
    * When the pages loads
    * Any time state changes
  * constructor
    * When an object is created
  * componentDidMount
    * After the first component render
* Optimistic Rendering
  * Update the page before the fetch request
* Pessimistic Rendering
  * Assuming that something would
  * Update the page after fetch request
