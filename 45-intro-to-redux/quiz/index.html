      <h2>Glossary / Puzzle Pieces</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>store</strong>An object {} that holds the state of the application and provides us with methods for
          manipulating it, including dispatch() and getState().</li>
        <li><strong>state</strong>The data that must be remembered in order for the app to function, an object {}.</li>
        <li><strong>action</strong>An object {} that represents a change request, similar to an HTTP request. It has a
          type, which states what to do, and optionally, a payload containing data required to complete the request.
        </li>
        <li><strong>dispatch</strong>A method available on the store, which accepts an action as an argument. It calls
          the reducer with the current state in the store and the action in order to reassign the state.</li>
        <li><strong>reducer</strong>A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and then uses (or
          reduces)
          that data to return the new state. It contains a switch statement for routing/handling actions.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>An event occurs on the frontend, such as a button click or page load, signalling that the app's state might need to change.</p>

    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>The state of the app is in the store. Which two puzzle pieces do we need to tell the store we'd like to make a change?</p>
    <div class="answer">store.<input type="text"><span>(</span><input type="text"><span>)</span></div>

    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p>The request must be handled. Which puzzle piece handles it and what does it require to execute properly?</p>
    <div class="answer"><input type="text"><span>(</span><input type="text"><span>,</span> <input type="text"><span>)</span></div>

    <h3>Step 4:</h3>
    <p>It's time to update the state! Which puzzle piece returns the new state and where is the new state stored?</p>
    <div class="answer">The <input type="text"> returns the new state, which is stored in the <input type="text">.</div>
