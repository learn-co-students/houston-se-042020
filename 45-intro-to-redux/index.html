  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Build createStore(). It stores the state. The state is reassignable.</li>
    <li>Write a method inside the store called getState(). It returns the state.</li>
    <li>The store needs to accept a reducer as an argument, which is used to set the initial state and create new state.</li>
    <li>Write a method called dispatch(). It invokes the reducer with the current state and an action. It then reassigns the state.</li>
    <li>Test your code so far. Write a reducer that sets the initial state to { cats: ['Meowser', 'Charlie', 'Fluffanilla'], selectedCat: 'Meowser' }</li>
    <li>Test your code with an action. Try adding a cat. Update the reducer to handle this action.</li>
    <li>Can you make a more dynamic/flexible action, say with an action creator so you can add any name you like?</li>
    <li>For practice, add another action: one that changes the selected cat, but only if it's in the cats list.</li>
    <li>BONUS: Write a function combineReducers(), which takes an object as an argument. The object maps reducers to keys. The combined reducer returned by the function will then be provided to createStore().</li>
  </ol>
